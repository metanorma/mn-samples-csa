<semantic__p id="semantic___6108f09d-ace5-3ecf-3d30-eb26e5d69a1a">In today’s hyper-competitive context with increasing cybersecurity threats, especially in the cloud, organizations are under strong pressure to streamline information security management processes. The age-old problem of resource limitations is exacerbated — the tradition of information security management systems (ISMS) is seemingly too rigid in structure, yet inadequate in responsiveness to
new needs.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___d25935ad-2fe6-04b3-3d34-35e650cd9e11">Organizations today are faced with a number of information security management issues, including:</semantic__p>

<semantic__title>Learning from the Collaborative Philosophy</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___231a03ad-47fe-050b-7c6a-b97faa566d99">DevOps, the practice of applying developmental best practices such as collective collaboration to
infrastructure operations, has been shown to positively impact efficiencies of development and
operations teams today, especially in the cloud environment.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___ffed6032-e96c-7294-d161-a3006f7a7efa">Given its strengthening adoption, it is necessary to consider its impact on information security itself

<semantic__p id="semantic___895e4c78-3f46-d0b5-4f7e-a6543e1d1191">DevOps is now broadly practiced but it has been generally separated from security practices. There
is currently no standardized term in industry that cater to this aspect. A number of terms have been
proposed by members of the community, including “DevOpsSec”, “DevSecOps”, “SecDevOps”, to explain
the intersection of security and DevOps, as well as the amalgamation of security, development and
operations practices.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___829ae681-0a02-4913-355e-1de3e99f4835">These terms have been used interchangeably, but the meanings they convey can be vastly different.
The definitions of these terms can also widely conflict with each other depending on the particular
understanding of the reader. Moreover, there is no industry recognized definition for security automation,
which is a core concept to the application of DevOps practices to security operations, leading to
confusion and misinterpretations. It is therefore crucial to clarify and standardize such terms for a global
and wider industry audience.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___07065840-8106-e4ef-671b-0eb5d68c5282">Reflexive Security is an approach for information security management built upon the principles
of Agile and DevOps. It is a non-prescriptive framework that is purely needs-based, emphasizes
collective responsibility, and considers information security and its responses to be a holistic
function of the organization.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___18c5d74a-6026-c73d-5e27-b3234b82e094">The word “Reflexive” is used for its meaning from the reflexive relation in mathematical sets, where
every element in a such a relation is related to itself. In Reflexive Security, every action taken is
related to the context and needs of the organization itself.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___4439733b-9f10-e912-1c1e-b6616be08244">Reflexive Security emphasizes security across organizational roles that reacts to external and internal
threats in an agile and dynamic way. It aims to be a new information security management strategy
that is dynamic, interactive, effective and holistic.</semantic__p>
</semantic__clause>

<semantic__clause id="semantic___relationship_with_isms" obligation="normative">
<semantic__title>Relationship with ISMS</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___8de6a7b7-c69a-ad43-da08-95a19c9c3e41">Comparing to the traditional Information Security Management System (ISMS) approach, Reflexive
Security aims to follow a similar spirit as Agile software development when compared to the
Waterfall mindset.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___209524d7-e5e7-25d7-3e81-e969fb5863e6">Reflexive Security treasures dynamic information exchange within the organization. Like the
immune system of the human body, information is immediately propagated to adjacent, potentially
vulnerable functions given detection of a threat. A traditional ISMS approach is top-down: it requires
threat information to be reported back to the higher functions, before any response can be made. In
Reflexive Security, organization functions themselves are already integrated with security functions,
and can provide an immediate response to address potential impact. A centralized response is
important, but should not prohibit an immediate tactical approach.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___a74b4403-993b-ca1b-82bf-84303b84d8c3">The ISMS approach is about adopting best practices. However, often best practices that work in
larger organizations do not work with smaller ones. In fact, they can create an unnecessary burden
for smaller organizations, taking away precious time and effort and hence negatively affecting their
information security stances.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___a79c044d-d4d4-1896-4c9b-45753e0dc93a">Reflexive Security also alleviates the security skills shortage paradox by promoting the idea of “hybrid
domain-security experts”, by delegating risks and security responsibilities to organization functions.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___50eae72a-c454-486c-895d-f7cc5bdfe47d">Top leadership commitment as required in an ISMS, while crucial, is insufficient. Top leadership has to
understand the nature of information security and needs to be committed to integrating information
security into each and every aspect of the organization. Top leadership must be themselves
integrated into the information security function — fully understanding the risks and threats the
organization faces (its risk profile) with regards to information security, setting clear bounds and
requirements for personnel to adhere to.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___a59f6fdf-a972-d0ec-9ce6-b8ddd49a3664">The human link is often the weakest link in information security. Phishing, social engineering are
all techniques to trick an unsuspecting individual to voluntarily compromise the security of an
organization. Without full and active participation of the involved individuals, beyond awareness,
information security simply cannot be achieved.</semantic__p>

<semantic__title>Responsible collectively</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___96577955-c2bf-d020-99b4-43b66b41b2ec">Security leadership plays a shepherding role for information security within an organization.
However, everyone is responsible for an organization’s security. Each individual has their own security
responsibility, and they must be aware of their own contribution (and potential problems) towards
the organization’s security stance. Edge users not only have to be security-aware, they are the first
line of defence for the organization.</semantic__p>
</semantic__clause>

<semantic__clause id="semantic___pragmatic" obligation="normative">
<semantic__title>Pragmatic</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___b63a8694-9831-c9a0-8d85-d5d01f23e54d">Security should provide value, not a hindrance. For every security initiative or adopted security
control, a cost-benefit should be prepared demonstrating the value of security. Without a pragmatic
approach, it is easy for persons unaware of the benefits of security to dismiss security practices
as mere overhead or unnecessary. A pragmatic approach provides crucial information in building
business case evidence to convince stakeholders of the importance of security, giving them
confidence that plans will be executed faithfully.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___0dbebb5e-769a-add7-059f-1c47672cb6a7">The traditional ISMS approach relies on a best practices approach which could easily lead to
overhead. Rarely are organizations not resource-constrained, and it is necessary to balance tailoring
requirements to the organization against the adoption of best practices. Requirements must be
based on organizational risks and value for maximum effectiveness.</semantic__p>

<semantic__title>Align and bridge</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___f33c372f-faf1-3d14-0c74-795278e7cb91">Organizational risks and requirements must be fully aligned in order to derive maximum effectiveness
and value from security processes. Security requirements that misalign with organizational risks
represent resources potentially wasted, or worse, attention that has been taken away from critical
matters that could cause organizational harm. By carefully aligning requirements throughout the
organizational context, such as contractual, regulatory, product, security and compliance requirements,
it is possible to extract maximum value by condensing a set of core requirements for the organization,
allowing the delegation of risk management at more tactical levels for more dynamic responses and
efficient usage of resources.</semantic__p>
</semantic__clause>

<semantic__clause id="semantic___automate" obligation="normative">
<semantic__title>Automate</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___43763883-3bd8-70bb-76e8-8e7ebeae05b0">Automated security practices are the core of optimizing process efficiency. Processes that can be
automated should be automated, and those that can’t should be transformed. Automation also
creates its own set of problems but automated approaches to those problems are often possible.
A mantra in software development says, if one does the same thing three times, it will be time to
program it. This approach applies squarely to Reflexive Security.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___fab8b44a-0bcb-7570-74b9-a7ff87bf6ed1">Performance that cannot be measured cannot be improved. Without measurements, there is no
understandable evidence whether information security management is effective. Reflexive Security
is about achieving results, and the results must be measurable for transparency and improvement.</semantic__p>

<semantic__title>Collaborate and integrate</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___276a71ae-89ac-7b5a-6719-d180d9dc6517">Security can only be achieved through collaboration, not confrontation. A security aware and
collaborative culture is necessary for everyone to feel comfortable reporting potential anomalies. The
human factor is often the weakest link — most security incidents are caused by inadvertent human error.
Security must be integrated into every aspect of business. Dedicated security personnel rarely have
in-depth business domain expertise. No one else knows the business domain and its risks as well as
those responsible for it. A team of dedicated security experts are likely oblivious of domain-specific
security issues. Domain knowledge and security knowledge must be fused and co-exist in every
organizational process for effective security management.</semantic__p>

and SecDevOps practices, placed within a holistic framework. These areas of practice all derive from the
integration of security and DevOps principles, together with essential concepts from Agile.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___fb5f1a53-bd74-10c2-3821-aa177ce43b15">Concepts made apparent by Agile software development practices (where “Agile” is the generic term
including practices like Scrum), such as incremental development, collaborative authoring, test- or
behavior-driven programming, and continuous integration, have given rise to infrastructure operation
practices such as continuous delivery, software-defined infrastructure and infrastructure automation.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___1f832282-6606-4d67-0160-d524eeb181f2">These infrastructure-related practices are widely considered to be part of the “DevOps” repertoire,

<semantic__p id="semantic___1edf5b55-a3b7-a415-f662-642b2e2d68ad">The practice of “SecDevOps”, or “Security DevOps”, aims to utilize DevOps practices to the
implementation of information security processes. Similar to how DevOps concepts are able
to improve the collaborative nature of development and infrastructure operations, SecDevOps
integrates and facilitates collaboration of development with information security processes. A
common result is the automation of information security processes (the “build”), accompanied by
allowing development processes to be abreast of security implications and deliverable feedback.</semantic__p>

<semantic__title>Culture Shock</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___0319d6c3-42ca-781e-3216-fbb8c1aff458">The goal of DevOps has been to write code and move product into production as fast as possible
while maintaining a single source of truth, and removing or sidelining any barriers to their progress.
The goal of security has always been too protect the organization internally and externally from
access. Individually the goals are admirable until it gets to the point where DevOps deploys insecure
software or security delays deployments to the point where the organization’s goals are affected.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___73eb4043-82d8-5ecb-b367-7f82487ded31">Embedding Security into DevOps can be a shock to the traditional system. Plan to deal with the

<semantic__title>Conclusion</semantic__title>
<semantic__p id="semantic___e69dfbfd-9553-bb8a-2048-64def1e177cd">Reflexive Security is a newer information security management strategy that is dynamic, interactive,
holistic, and effective. It represents an integrated culture extrapolated from the amalgamation of
DevSecOps, DevOpsSec and SecDevOps concepts and practices, and promotes the exemplary
contexts from which those best practices were derived from.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___eb916392-00cf-f34e-7f59-3acbfeed84b0">Reflexive Security provides a set of wide-implicating and easily understandable principles that
affect an organization’s cybersecurity posture, especially suitable for operating under resource and
personnel constraints in today’s fast-paced and challenging cybersecurity landscape.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___1470cff5-854a-0159-7e87-adea6d81d229">The implementation of DevSecOps, DevOpsSec and SecDevOps concepts and practices in an
organization provides an excellent start in attaining the benefits of Reflexive Security. It is also
straightforward for organizations that utilize Reflexive Security to formally adopt an ISMS as
appropriate, by integrating ISMS processes as part of the Reflexive Security strategy.</semantic__p>

<p id="_6108f09d-ace5-3ecf-3d30-eb26e5d69a1a">In today’s hyper-competitive context with increasing cybersecurity threats, especially in the cloud, organizations are under strong pressure to streamline information security management processes. The age-old problem of resource limitations is exacerbated — the tradition of information security management systems (ISMS) is seemingly too rigid in structure, yet inadequate in responsiveness to
new needs.</p>

<p id="_d25935ad-2fe6-04b3-3d34-35e650cd9e11">Organizations today are faced with a number of information security management issues, including:</p>

<ul id="_41559afb-d196-eebc-f68c-8e2fbfbd5bb5"><li><p id="_c83a3d99-a5db-f3be-bb93-19f1d40f734b">Spiralling compliance governance costs;</p>

<p id="_231a03ad-47fe-050b-7c6a-b97faa566d99">DevOps, the practice of applying developmental best practices such as collective collaboration to
infrastructure operations, has been shown to positively impact efficiencies of development and
operations teams today, especially in the cloud environment.</p>

<p id="_ffed6032-e96c-7294-d161-a3006f7a7efa">Given its strengthening adoption, it is necessary to consider its impact on information security itself
and look to apply those practices to the arena of information security management.</p>

<p id="_64b7b9aa-cdd7-e57b-c861-aac13eea8033">Distilling from the cultural and philosophical elements of such collaborative practices, as well as from

<p id="_895e4c78-3f46-d0b5-4f7e-a6543e1d1191">DevOps is now broadly practiced but it has been generally separated from security practices. There
is currently no standardized term in industry that cater to this aspect. A number of terms have been
proposed by members of the community, including “DevOpsSec”, “DevSecOps”, “SecDevOps”, to explain
the intersection of security and DevOps, as well as the amalgamation of security, development and
operations practices.</p>

<p id="_829ae681-0a02-4913-355e-1de3e99f4835">These terms have been used interchangeably, but the meanings they convey can be vastly different.
The definitions of these terms can also widely conflict with each other depending on the particular
understanding of the reader. Moreover, there is no industry recognized definition for security automation,
which is a core concept to the application of DevOps practices to security operations, leading to
confusion and misinterpretations. It is therefore crucial to clarify and standardize such terms for a global
and wider industry audience.</p>

<title depth="2">4.1.<tab/>General</title>
<p id="_07065840-8106-e4ef-671b-0eb5d68c5282">Reflexive Security is an approach for information security management built upon the principles
of Agile and DevOps. It is a non-prescriptive framework that is purely needs-based, emphasizes
collective responsibility, and considers information security and its responses to be a holistic
function of the organization.</p>

<p id="_18c5d74a-6026-c73d-5e27-b3234b82e094">The word “Reflexive” is used for its meaning from the reflexive relation in mathematical sets, where
every element in a such a relation is related to itself. In Reflexive Security, every action taken is
related to the context and needs of the organization itself.</p>

<p id="_4439733b-9f10-e912-1c1e-b6616be08244">Reflexive Security emphasizes security across organizational roles that reacts to external and internal
threats in an agile and dynamic way. It aims to be a new information security management strategy
that is dynamic, interactive, effective and holistic.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_relationship_with_isms" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">4.2.<tab/>Relationship with ISMS</title>
<p id="_8de6a7b7-c69a-ad43-da08-95a19c9c3e41">Comparing to the traditional Information Security Management System (ISMS) approach, Reflexive
Security aims to follow a similar spirit as Agile software development when compared to the
Waterfall mindset.</p>

<p id="_209524d7-e5e7-25d7-3e81-e969fb5863e6">Reflexive Security treasures dynamic information exchange within the organization. Like the
immune system of the human body, information is immediately propagated to adjacent, potentially
vulnerable functions given detection of a threat. A traditional ISMS approach is top-down: it requires
threat information to be reported back to the higher functions, before any response can be made. In
Reflexive Security, organization functions themselves are already integrated with security functions,
and can provide an immediate response to address potential impact. A centralized response is
important, but should not prohibit an immediate tactical approach.</p>

<p id="_a74b4403-993b-ca1b-82bf-84303b84d8c3">The ISMS approach is about adopting best practices. However, often best practices that work in
larger organizations do not work with smaller ones. In fact, they can create an unnecessary burden
for smaller organizations, taking away precious time and effort and hence negatively affecting their
information security stances.</p>

<p id="_a79c044d-d4d4-1896-4c9b-45753e0dc93a">Reflexive Security also alleviates the security skills shortage paradox by promoting the idea of “hybrid
domain-security experts”, by delegating risks and security responsibilities to organization functions.</p>

<p id="_50eae72a-c454-486c-895d-f7cc5bdfe47d">Top leadership commitment as required in an ISMS, while crucial, is insufficient. Top leadership has to
understand the nature of information security and needs to be committed to integrating information
security into each and every aspect of the organization. Top leadership must be themselves
integrated into the information security function — fully understanding the risks and threats the
organization faces (its risk profile) with regards to information security, setting clear bounds and
requirements for personnel to adhere to.</p>

<p id="_a59f6fdf-a972-d0ec-9ce6-b8ddd49a3664">The human link is often the weakest link in information security. Phishing, social engineering are
all techniques to trick an unsuspecting individual to voluntarily compromise the security of an
organization. Without full and active participation of the involved individuals, beyond awareness,
information security simply cannot be achieved.</p>

<title depth="2">5.2.<tab/>Responsible collectively</title>
<p id="_96577955-c2bf-d020-99b4-43b66b41b2ec">Security leadership plays a shepherding role for information security within an organization.
However, everyone is responsible for an organization’s security. Each individual has their own security
responsibility, and they must be aware of their own contribution (and potential problems) towards
the organization’s security stance. Edge users not only have to be security-aware, they are the first
line of defence for the organization.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_pragmatic" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">5.3.<tab/>Pragmatic</title>
<p id="_b63a8694-9831-c9a0-8d85-d5d01f23e54d">Security should provide value, not a hindrance. For every security initiative or adopted security
control, a cost-benefit should be prepared demonstrating the value of security. Without a pragmatic
approach, it is easy for persons unaware of the benefits of security to dismiss security practices
as mere overhead or unnecessary. A pragmatic approach provides crucial information in building
business case evidence to convince stakeholders of the importance of security, giving them
confidence that plans will be executed faithfully.</p>

<p id="_0dbebb5e-769a-add7-059f-1c47672cb6a7">The traditional ISMS approach relies on a best practices approach which could easily lead to
overhead. Rarely are organizations not resource-constrained, and it is necessary to balance tailoring
requirements to the organization against the adoption of best practices. Requirements must be
based on organizational risks and value for maximum effectiveness.</p>

<clause id="_align_and_bridge" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">5.4.<tab/>Align and bridge</title>
<p id="_f33c372f-faf1-3d14-0c74-795278e7cb91">Organizational risks and requirements must be fully aligned in order to derive maximum effectiveness
and value from security processes. Security requirements that misalign with organizational risks
represent resources potentially wasted, or worse, attention that has been taken away from critical
matters that could cause organizational harm. By carefully aligning requirements throughout the
organizational context, such as contractual, regulatory, product, security and compliance requirements,
it is possible to extract maximum value by condensing a set of core requirements for the organization,
allowing the delegation of risk management at more tactical levels for more dynamic responses and
efficient usage of resources.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_automate" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">5.5.<tab/>Automate</title>
<p id="_43763883-3bd8-70bb-76e8-8e7ebeae05b0">Automated security practices are the core of optimizing process efficiency. Processes that can be
automated should be automated, and those that can’t should be transformed. Automation also
creates its own set of problems but automated approaches to those problems are often possible.
A mantra in software development says, if one does the same thing three times, it will be time to
program it. This approach applies squarely to Reflexive Security.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_measure_and_improve" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">5.6.<tab/>Measure and improve</title>
<p id="_fab8b44a-0bcb-7570-74b9-a7ff87bf6ed1">Performance that cannot be measured cannot be improved. Without measurements, there is no
understandable evidence whether information security management is effective. Reflexive Security
is about achieving results, and the results must be measurable for transparency and improvement.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_collaborate_and_integrate" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">5.7.<tab/>Collaborate and integrate</title>
<p id="_276a71ae-89ac-7b5a-6719-d180d9dc6517">Security can only be achieved through collaboration, not confrontation. A security aware and
collaborative culture is necessary for everyone to feel comfortable reporting potential anomalies. The
human factor is often the weakest link — most security incidents are caused by inadvertent human error.
Security must be integrated into every aspect of business. Dedicated security personnel rarely have
in-depth business domain expertise. No one else knows the business domain and its risks as well as
those responsible for it. A team of dedicated security experts are likely oblivious of domain-specific
security issues. Domain knowledge and security knowledge must be fused and co-exist in every
organizational process for effective security management.</p>

<p id="_2f39ca39-0e66-8ad6-b758-f579cfb51b08">Reflexive Security can be considered as the amalgamation and integration of the DevSecOps, DevOpsSec
and SecDevOps practices, placed within a holistic framework. These areas of practice all derive from the
integration of security and DevOps principles, together with essential concepts from Agile.</p>

<p id="_fb5f1a53-bd74-10c2-3821-aa177ce43b15">Concepts made apparent by Agile software development practices (where “Agile” is the generic term
including practices like Scrum), such as incremental development, collaborative authoring, test- or
behavior-driven programming, and continuous integration, have given rise to infrastructure operation
practices such as continuous delivery, software-defined infrastructure and infrastructure automation.</p>

<p id="_1f832282-6606-4d67-0160-d524eeb181f2">These infrastructure-related practices are widely considered to be part of the “DevOps” repertoire,
but with several conflicting definitions of what exactly the term represents, it is necessary to clarify
and standardize its definition in order to evaluate and address its information security impact<fn reference="1"><p id="_08ac55f4-4b1a-05d5-e574-6002a4b93ab5">For example, the Wikipedia article on DevOps defines it as “a set of practices that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and information technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes”. This definition is too vague for evaluating the impact of DevOps on information security practices.</p>

interaction between development and operations (e.g., the “build” and “run” processes), or in some
cases, have minimal impact in complex enterprise teams where logistics and governance controls

<title depth="1">8.<tab/>Relevant guidelines for implementing Reflexive Security</title>
<clause id="_general_8" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">8.1.<tab/>General</title>
<p id="_b151b883-c3a8-4427-f85b-e17fc9d02f5c">This clause provides some guidelines for organizations for the implementation of Reflexive Security.
The guidelines below are meant to be indicative, not exhaustive.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_culture_shock" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">8.2.<tab/>Culture Shock</title>
<p id="_0319d6c3-42ca-781e-3216-fbb8c1aff458">The goal of DevOps has been to write code and move product into production as fast as possible
while maintaining a single source of truth, and removing or sidelining any barriers to their progress.
The goal of security has always been too protect the organization internally and externally from
access. Individually the goals are admirable until it gets to the point where DevOps deploys insecure
software or security delays deployments to the point where the organization’s goals are affected.</p>

<p id="_73eb4043-82d8-5ecb-b367-7f82487ded31">Embedding Security into DevOps can be a shock to the traditional system. Plan to deal with the
issues of DevOps and Security working closely with common goals and metrics. Plan for the personal
effects of automation: changed, lost and or new positions.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_cross_train" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">8.3.<tab/>Cross-train</title>
<p id="_b3d581c9-5b0e-dfdc-36a2-2c37ee67141f">Form an operational security function by selecting key persons that have an interest or background in
security from each team and delegate security related tasks to those individuals. Make these persons
a representative of the operational security teams.</p>

<p id="_d088781c-9a18-efbb-c1d6-067a7b8db09f">The operational security teams know exactly what types of operating systems are used, applications
are supported for the business, etc. In some organizations, this collaboration involves embedding IT
operations specialists within software development teams, thus forming a cross-functional team.
This effort may also be combined with a skills matrix.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_delegate" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">8.4.<tab/>Delegate</title>
<p id="_30c49851-bd9e-5204-dc88-9222096c9bd0">Delegate risk management, maintenance of BCPs etc. to department heads. Freeing up resources of
the dedicated security team so they can focus on the security process management and providing
the framework(s). The department heads know exactly what they have in house, what risks there are.</p>

<p id="_5b9e4ee1-b4df-5c93-9dbc-38c90e646685">Reflexive Security is process neutral. Organizations can use Agile, Scrum or any other development
methodology. Have security engineers attend daily scrum meetings, make them part of the team.</p>
</clause>

<clause id="_automate_with_purpose" obligation="normative">
<title depth="2">8.5.<tab/>Automate with purpose</title>
<p id="_5ad918a1-7ab4-b1c4-9509-2e7ca4439f2b">One of the primary rules of DevSecOps is to automate early and often with the goal to embed
security into the process but don’t try to automate everything at once. Select those areas that will
address the greatest risk for automation first. Also choose your automation tools using a selection
method including testing that reflects the specifics of your environment.</p>
</clause>
</clause>

<clause id="_conclusion" obligation="normative" displayorder="11">
<title depth="1">9.<tab/>Conclusion</title>
<p id="_e69dfbfd-9553-bb8a-2048-64def1e177cd">Reflexive Security is a newer information security management strategy that is dynamic, interactive,
holistic, and effective. It represents an integrated culture extrapolated from the amalgamation of
DevSecOps, DevOpsSec and SecDevOps concepts and practices, and promotes the exemplary
contexts from which those best practices were derived from.</p>

<p id="_eb916392-00cf-f34e-7f59-3acbfeed84b0">Reflexive Security provides a set of wide-implicating and easily understandable principles that
affect an organization’s cybersecurity posture, especially suitable for operating under resource and
personnel constraints in today’s fast-paced and challenging cybersecurity landscape.</p>

<p id="_1470cff5-854a-0159-7e87-adea6d81d229">The implementation of DevSecOps, DevOpsSec and SecDevOps concepts and practices in an
organization provides an excellent start in attaining the benefits of Reflexive Security. It is also
straightforward for organizations that utilize Reflexive Security to formally adopt an ISMS as
appropriate, by integrating ISMS processes as part of the Reflexive Security strategy.</p>
